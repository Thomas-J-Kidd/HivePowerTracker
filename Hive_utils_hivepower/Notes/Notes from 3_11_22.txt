
general outline 

collect usernames in text file
function that sets the usernames into the data collector
function that sends messages / notifications (email,)
          - update when the notification was sent to the user
          - collect notification time for each user and store it in a dictionary 
pay us a subscription fee of #hive per week/month/year or some timeframe

-------------------------------
phase 1
-------------------------------
flow
user signs up for service
once signed up we get that username into a text file
take each user name from text file and pass it through the data function: then check hive power and time remaining to full charge

initially test / store in google form 
google collab notebook - execute our python scripts. 
send a notification that they signed up and display their hive power % and time remaining until full
send notification when hive power is at 99% or 100% 
develop a formula for how often to check back based on persentage 
after every 30 minutes we check 
-------------------------------





difference between hive node being compensated or not is not related to computation is being given out, its all about the witness votes.
